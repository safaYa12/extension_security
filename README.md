# 🔐 Browser Extension Audit — Practical Cybersecurity Task

## 📌 Task Overview
This mini project demonstrates how to audit, analyze, and manage browser extensions to reduce security and privacy risks.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify unused or suspicious browser extensions.
- Check permissions and developer trustworthiness.
- Remove any potentially malicious add-ons.
- Improve browser performance and security.

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Opened the browser’s extension/add-ons manager (`chrome://extensions/`).
2. Reviewed all installed extensions, noted unnecessary ones.
3. Checked permissions and user reviews for each extension.
4. Identified extensions with excessive permissions or poor reputation.
5. Removed suspicious/unneeded extensions.
6. Restarted the browser and confirmed improved performance.
7. Researched how malicious extensions can:
   - Steal browsing data.
   - Inject ads.
   - Redirect users to phishing sites.
   - Log keystrokes.
8. Documented all changes and learnings.

## 📊 Outcome
- Browser cleaned of unwanted add-ons.
- Better understanding of how malicious extensions work.
- Improved awareness of extension permissions and developer trust.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
Browser extensions can be a hidden risk if unmanaged. Regular audits help prevent data leaks and maintain strong browser security hygiene.
